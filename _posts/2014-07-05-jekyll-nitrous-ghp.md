> I am not a blogger .. _but_ .. I have made the decision to become a software developer .. _and_ .. it has come to my attention that the aforementioned blog .. _alot_ .. soooo .. when in Rome.

After reviewing alot of and trying a few blogging solutions, I have finally settled on what I consider to provide the most value and ease when posting about and with code snippets. I came across [this blog post](http://juristr.com/blog/2013/05/blog-like-a-hacker-with-jekyll-and-nitrousio/ "Blog Like a Hacker with Jekyll and Nitrous.IO") suggests a \"hacker friendly\" solution using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and [Nitrous.IO](https://www.nitrous.io/ "Nitrous"). I will attempt to chronicle my experiences regarding.

**Why Jekyll and Nitrous.IO?** Two words .. _[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)_.  

As per its [help docs](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages), GHPages 
_\"are public webpages freely hosted and easily published through\"_ GH. Here are some helpful links of useful how-to\'s describing ways to:

- [get started with Nitrous.io and Jekyll](http://silshack.github.io/spring2014/how-to/2014/01/29/nitrousgit.html)
- [build a blog with Jekyll and GitHub pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/#more-197342)
- [use Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)  

Soooo \... due to the fact that I have spent the better part of the last year leveling-up my GH in terms of skills and content, am always connected to the effin internet via a different mobile device, and as Juri points out, use of the **Jekyll-Nitrous-GHPages** combo _\"reflects the kind of blogging experience you want as a dev, with Markdown support, full version control and amazing hosting\"_ \... This setup solves a potentially complicated and time-consuming problem for me.  

**Start Blogging**  

Now you can open the corresponding blog markdown file in the Nitrous.io web IDE and start writing your blog post. Here is a [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) that I used to create a [markdown cheatsheet](http://sskenner.github.io/2014/01/31/jekyll-md-info.html) for myself. Afterwards, you can directly run Jekyll on Nitrous by typing <code>jekyll serve</code> at the command line and preview the resulting posts in the browser while writing it using the _Preview_ feature found on the _File_ menu. Done, done and done.
