Although I have been advised that 
[**Conquering The Command Line**](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/basics#chapter-basics)
, by Mark Bates, is a great resource for learning **Unix and Linux Commands** for Developers, I find myself referring to
[**The Command Line Crash Course**](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
, by Zed. A. Shaw, when I have a command line brain fart. It is a very informative tutorial for n00bs to get the basics of navigating unix-like command line ecosystems. 

For maximum value .. I will reiterate Shaw\'s sentiment regarding the exercises:

**\<Shaw>** \"Shut up and type all of this in\"

**\<moi>** _.. bullet-bullet .. reee-wind_ .. 

Mr. Shaw orders you to:

**\<Shaw>** _\"Shut up and type all of this in.\"_**

He then goes on to explain:

**\<Shaw>** \"Sorry to be mean, but that\'s what you have to do. If you have an irrational fear of the command line, _the only way to conquer an irrational fear is to just shut up and fight through it._\"** 

**\<moi>** _.. can i get an Amen_..

**\<Shaw>** \"You are not going to destroy your computer.\"** 

**\<moi>** _.. destroy .. no .. but could screw things up a bit._

**\<Shaw>** _\"You are not going to be thrown into some jail at the bottom of Microsoft\'s Redmond campus. Your friends won\'t laugh at you for being a nerd. Simply ignore any stupid weird reasons you have for fearing the command line.\"_

\"Why? Because _if you want to learn to code_, then _you must learn this_. Programming languages are advanced ways to control your computer with language. The command line is the baby little brother of programming languages. _Learning the command line teaches you to control the computer using language._\"

**note:** One of the goals of the aforementioned pearls of wisdom is to encourage you to consciously work on the development of your fingers muscle memory so that it coincides with programming skill development. FYI .. as a dev, you will encounter this phrase *A-lot* .. Nuff said.
