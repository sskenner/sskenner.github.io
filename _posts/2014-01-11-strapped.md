After spending an obnoxious amount of time finding the **combo of dev tools** that can keep up with my _can\'t-sit-still-to-save-my-life_ steelo, i have settled on the following arsenal .. _for now_:

* **MacBook Air**
  * 11-in 1.3G Intel Core i5 4G 1600 MHz DDR3 
* OSX **Mavericks** v 10.9.3
* [**Sublime Text 2** v 2.0.2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [**Base** v 2.4.8](http://menial.co.uk/base/)
* [**Nitrous.IO**](http://nitrous.io/)

and of course

* [**Rails 4**.0.0](http://railsinstaller.org/en)
* [**Ruby 2**.0.0p247](http://railsinstaller.org/en)

> _Big ups_ to [Nitrous.IO](http://nitrous.io/) for making it possible for me to get it poppin anywhere .. anytime. As per the marketing, it is _a full-featured IDE in your browser which enables anyone to code a variety of languages (Ruby, Python, Go, NodeJS and PHP) and run web servers, databases, caches and more right from the menubar._ Please bow your heads and join me in a moment of silence .. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
