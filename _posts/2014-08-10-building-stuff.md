> It is a law of life that problems arise when conditions are there for their solution.
~ [Walter Sisulu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Sisulu)

I believe that every problem has a solution. I like to create solutions to problems. It is my understadning and has been my experience that _software development_ and _engineering_ allows an individual to accomplish this:  

- without the help of others
- at scale
- with the help of others
- with little to no financial investment
- for virtually any problem in any domain that can be described

**Question** ..

> What other skillset can claim the same?

Take your time .. I will wait .. **Bueller Bueller Bueller**
