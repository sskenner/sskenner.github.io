The following are some tasks and excerpts I am using as my guide to secure an opportunity as a Full Stack Ruby Web Developer. These insights are brought to you (via me) and made possible by Barry Clark\'s very (IMO) informative [blog](http://www.barryclark.co/).

> Just seeing what kind of work people have done, and what sort of online artifacts they\'ve created, is tremendously helpful in getting a sense of what people do and what they\'re good (or bad) at. - Jeff Atwood, co-founder, Stack Exchange

> employers want to see your work, as live websites, screenshots, git commits, blog posts, presentations, and code snippets. - Barry Clark, dir tech prod, DoSomething.org

Barry recommends the careful curation of ones digital footprint. Specifically, the inclusion of:

- an online portfolio (_list of helpful tools [here](http://mashable.com/2013/09/17/online-portfolio/)_)
- a list of recent projects
- links to Open source project work
- blog posts
- [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/sites) & other relevant communities i.e. [/r/webdev](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev), [codepen](http://codepen.io/), [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
- [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/) presentations

He then goes on to advise regarding the packaging of aforementioned footprint. Ones information should be displayed:

- in-line relevant footprint links in your resume
- as a bullet list in cover email
- in the About page on personal site  

He wraps up his lesson with a directive to ..

> take anything offline that wouldn\'t be aligned with the company culturally. This includes anything on your:

- personal site/portfolio/blog
- GitHub
- platform specific sites (e.g. Drupal.org)
- Twitter
- Facebook
- online query results (i.e. Google et al)
