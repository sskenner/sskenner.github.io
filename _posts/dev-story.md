Considering that my previous experience is in Information Technology Services, it should be of little surprise that I've always been amazed by the disruptive properties of technology innovation. So much so that I have spent my career creating and managing innovative technology driven solutions for organizations and individuals alike.

After co-founding a nonprofit whose mission is to help the underserved leverage tech to improve quality of life, our work was recognized and supported by THE biggest name in internet services and products. As a grassroots organization, I know we are beyond fortunate to benefit from such a high profile opportunity but, after exposure to the inner workings of our benefactor, I realized that we have only scratched the surface. Teaching technology use, although a low-floor/high-ceiling/wide-walls approach to eradicate digital inequality, is not the solution... teaching technology creation is. <need?> And since I do not expect of anyone anything that I would not expect of myself, it was time to level up my software development skills. <need?>

Even though I worked long hours developing technology programming for the org, I made it a priority to level up my software development skills. The advent of MOOCS (Udacity, EdX, Coursera) and online interactive platforms (Codecademy, Code School, Learnstreet) provided the opportunity to learn the basics of Ruby, Python, HTML and CSS. The "secrets" of the software creation process were beginning to unfold. Slowly.

After about a year of dual effort at work in program development and teaching myself programming, I felt that it was time to take it to the next level. If I am to create programs that teach technology creation, it was time to make my desire to learn programming both an official and full time commiment. I enrolled in Tealeaf Academy's intensive 16-week bootcamp and set off to become a Ruby on Rails developer capable of building advanced production-level applications using industry best practices and deployment techniques. Since my enrollment in and graduation of Tealeaf, not only I have worked on projects that help solve technology problems and are maintained in an open source environment, but I have helped others do the same. 

Even though my initial motivation was to help others improve quality of life through technology creation, I ultimately helped myself. I now have the experience, skills and confidence to be a valuable contributor to any RoR project or team. 

<???>If part time experience has made me competent, full time employment will no doubt make me an expert.<???>
