- ??how to embed youtube vidz??

after trying a bunch of different combinations of dev tools, the following are my weapons of choice:

* MacBook Air 11-in 1.3G Intel Core i5 4G 1600 MHz DDR3 
* OSX v 10.8.4
* Rails 4.0.0
* Ruby 2.0.0p247
* Sublime Text 2 v 2.0.2
* Base v 2.4.6
* Nitrous.IO

_honorable mention to the codelearn playground when working on computers that are not yours. it includes a browser based Terminal, File Browser, Code Editor and Preview._
