After trying a bunch of different combinations of dev tools, i have settled on the following arsenal .. _for now_:

* MacBook Air 11-in 1.3G Intel Core i5 4G 1600 MHz DDR3 
* OSX v 10.9.3
* [Sublime Text 2 v 2.0.2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [Base v 2.4.8](http://menial.co.uk/base/)
* [Nitrous.IO](http://nitrous.io/)

and of course

* [Rails 4.0.0](http://railsinstaller.org/en)
* [Ruby 2.0.0p247](http://railsinstaller.org/en)

_Big ups_ to [Nitrous.IO](http://nitrous.io/) for making it possible for me to get it poppin anywhere .. anytime. 

As per the marketing, it is _a full-featured IDE in your browser which enables anyone to code a variety of languages (Ruby, Python, Go, NodeJS and PHP) and run web servers, databases, caches and more right from the menubar._ Dope, Dope, Dope!
