I possess over a year and a half of web development experience and learning using the _Ruby on Rails stack_ **(ERB/Haml, MySQL, Rspec/Cucumber, Fat/Skinny models and controllers)**. In this time I have successfully completed a web development boot camp focused on full stack Rails development and served as a Teachers Assistant for the program.

A detailed listing of topics and features used to build and deploy production quality web applications of non-trivial size and complexity can be found on my GH below in the README.rdocs of the repos entitled [bootlegz](https://github.com/sskenner/bootlegz/blob/master/README.rdoc) and [qosdeez](https://github.com/sskenner/qosdeez/blob/master/README.rdoc).

Applications built include but are not limited to the following topics: 

| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| TDD/BDD        | REST           | MVC            | Integration    |
| Workflows      | e-Commerce     | Relational databases | Database assocs     |
| ActiveRecord   | Resourceful routing | Partials       | Helpers        |
| Filters        | Rails forms    | Validations    | Strong params  |
| Callbacks      | Authentication | Simple roles   | Deployment     |
| Polymrphc assocs| Ajax, the Rails way | Pretty URLs    | Building APIs  |
| Creating gems  | Publishng gems | Adv Rails Topics | Request/Response |

After spending an obnoxious amount of time finding the **combo of dev tools** that can keep up with my _can\'t-sit-still-to-save-my-life_ steelo, I have settled on the following arsenal .. _for now_:

* **MacBook Air** 11-in 1.3G Intel Core i5 4G 1600 MHz DDR3 
* OSX **Mavericks** v 10.9.3
* [**Sublime Text 2** v 2.0.2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* [**Base** v 2.4.8](http://menial.co.uk/base/)
* [**Nitrous.IO**](http://nitrous.io/)

> _Big ups_ to [Nitrous.IO](http://nitrous.io/) for making it possible for me to get it poppin anywhere .. anytime. As per the marketing, it is _a full-featured IDE in your browser which enables anyone to code a variety of languages (Ruby, Python, Go, NodeJS and PHP) and run web servers, databases, caches and more right from the menu bar._ Please bow your heads and join me in a moment of silence .. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
